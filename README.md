TokenHUB — The Game Changer

About TokenHub

TokenHub is a platform to be developed on the Binance Smart Chain, which seeks to connect and provide network users with access to top-level adult material provided by adult artists, while both remaining completely anonymous.

TokenHub is the social platform revolutionizing adult content creators and fans/subscribers connections. The site will be inclusive of adult content created by the users and will allow them to monetize such content while developing authentic relationships with their subscribers.

The team’s vision is to develop a site where creators can monetize their content free of advertisers. And, on the other hand, users willing to get content for adults didn’t have to provide their personal data to suspicious sites.

The problem TokenHub comes to solve.
It is a fact that nowadays there are hundreds of platforms that claim to provide adult material to their users anonymously, but the truth is that this is completely false. The user’s information is very vulnerable at all times and, in one way or another, ends coming up to light. As if it were not enough, these sites are always filled up with fake publicity or URLs which translate in the user’s privacy even more jeopardized. If not leaked, in the very best case scenario, wasting the user’s time closing pop-ups.

At TokenHub we are working to make such concerns disappear. We seek to provide effective solutions to our high-demanding users through an innovative platform.

Both parties (the content creator and the content requestor) will remain completely anonymous at all times. This is by being fully decentralized and linking our platform to the blockchain. The only thing you need is a wallet. No users, no email, no information.

Content creators may choose at their own will to monetize their content or make it free. The free personalized content will be provided by the platform to the users — content requestors — son a daily, weekly or monthly basis, depending on the plan that each user has.

On top of that, the platform will incorporate the best content of other porn content providers and dating apps. We will combine them all to offer the users a full and unique experience.

TokenHub’s mission

We have a clear mission. This is to provide solutions to our users, facilitating the creation of adult content and the connection with the creator fans. In addition to this, we will provide a decentralized payment system for those looking to monetize their content.

$HUB Token Value

The platform will offer 3 different types of subscriptions.

· The Standard one, where users will have access to free public content, even without holding tokens.

· The Basic subscription, where users will have access to a limited amount of exclusive content. To be part of the basic subscription the interested user will need to hold a certain amount of $HUB tokens defined by the community, and;

· The Gold subscription, users which hold a greater defined number of tokens will be part of the Gold plan. The Gold plan will grant greater privileges and access to all available content. Gold users also may request personalized content once a week to our partner content-providers.

This is how we plan to revolutionize the market. We don’t offer paid subscriptions as any other content provider, we favor the holders of $HUB. $HUB is a token with an intrinsic value which will allow their holders to access to premium adult content.
